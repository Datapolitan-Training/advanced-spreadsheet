> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

## -Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*

# What is Analysis?
--

> “Analysis is simply the pursuit of understanding, usually through detailed inspection or comparison”

## - Carter Hewgley, Former Director of Analytics, [Center for Government Excellence](https://govex.jhu.edu/)

# Final Thoughts
--

+ Data can tell a story, but doesn't speak for itself
--

+ Analysis is the search for understanding and where we learn to tell that story
--

+ Be good to your data and it will be good to you
