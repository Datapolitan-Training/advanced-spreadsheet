# Final Thoughts
--

+ Data can tell a story, but doesn't speak for itself
--

+ Analysis is the search for understanding and where we learn to tell that story
--

+ Be good to your data and it will be good to you

> “Do you have data to back that up?” should be a question that no one is afraid to ask (and everyone is prepared to answer)
